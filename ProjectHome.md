This is a web application created to show CPU and RAM usage graphs dynamically in a web browser.
It uses PHP and JQuery and runs on Linux (and potentially Unix) servers. Unfortunately Windows is not supported and never will be under my code-base.

You can see a working version of it here - http://zyk.dlinkddns.com/php-cpu-monitor/

Version 1.0 should work perfectly fine on any Linux system with no special features enabled. In fact a cool feature of it is that it will even work on shared hosting so you can see how loaded the web space you are paying for is!

Hope this is useful to you!

This software is completely free under no license, steal it, sell it, do whatever you want with it. Just give me some kudos, please! :D
